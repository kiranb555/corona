    Q: "Can you get infected with the coronavirus by mail (letters, parcels)?",
    A:
      "The chance that the virus is present on mail or parcels is very small in the Netherlands, but it is not entirely ruled out. In addition, the chance that the virus is still contagious is also very small. There is no evidence that people have been infected by mail. In general, we advise you to wash your hands regularly. A virus always needs a human or animal to survive and to be able to spread. Outside the body, the virus can only survive for a short time. Exactly how long that is is still unknown. This can vary from a few hours to a few days. This depends, for example, on the type of surface, temperature and humidity."

    Q:
      "What does keep your distance mean in relation to the novel coronavirus?",
    A:
      "Keeping a distance means keeping 1 to 2 meters (two arm lengths) away from each other to protect yourself and others from becoming infected with the coronavirus. By coughing and sneezing, small droplets of the coronavirus get in the air. People can breathe in these droplets and get infected.  When you sneeze, these droplets rarely reach more than 1 to 2 meters.        You can still go shopping, walking, cycling and pick up food, but try to keep your distance from others."

    Q:
      "Do paracetamol, ibuprofen or other medications help against the novel coronavirus?",
    A:
      "There is (yet) no medication against the novel coronavirus. Paracetamol and ibuprofen do not help to cure the virus but can reduce symptoms of fever, sore throat and malaise. There is currently no evidence that the use of paracetamol or ibuprofen (or diclofenac, or naproxen, so-called NSAIDs) actually worsen the disease caused by the virus. Paracetamol is preferred because it has the least side effects."

    Q:
      "Does it make sense to wear face masks to protect yourself against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)?",
    A:
      "In the Netherlands, we only recommend face masks for medical personnel. The problem is that it only helps if you use special masks that close very well over your nose and mouth. You need to use the masks very precisely and change them regularly. This is almost impossible in daily use. The simple (paper) mouth masks that many people use do not protect the carrier against the virus. Incorrect use of the mouth masks gives a false sense of security."
  },
  {
    Q:
      "Do you become less contagious if you disinfect your nose and throat with a disinfectant solution?",
    A:
      "No, this form of cleaning is not used to prevent infection or to treat a coronavirus infection. The virus may be present in the nose and/or throat. Cleaning the throat or nose separately, therefore, has no effect. Inserting a disinfectant solution into the nose may cause damage to the mucous membranes. This may increase the risk of infection with bacteria or even increase the spread of the coronavirus."
  },
  {
    Q:
      "Can you get infected with the coronavirus through products or touching surfaces? (e.g. door handle, ATM, handrail, money, etc.)",
    A:
      "The coronavirus spreads through people. Outside the body, the virus cannot survive well. The chance of getting infected by touching products or surfaces is very small.  Ensure you take the measures that apply to all viruses that can cause flu and colds and wash your hands regularly."
