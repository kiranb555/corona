    Q: "What is COVID-19?",
    A:
      "COVID-19 is a virus strain, first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, that has only spread in people since December 2019.  Health experts are closely monitoring the situation because little is known about this new virus and it has the potential to cause severe illness and pneumonia in some people."
  },
  {
    Q: "How does COVID-19 spread and what are the symptoms?",
    A:
      "COVID-19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets. That means to become infected, you generally must be within six feet of someone who is contagious and come into contact with these droplets. It may be possible to get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, Symptoms of COVID-19 appear within two to 14 days after exposure and include fever, cough, and shortness of breath."
  },
  {
    Q: "How long does it take for symptoms of the COVID-19 to appear?",
    A:
      "The CDC believes that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as two days, or as long as 14 days after exposure."
  },
  {
    Q: " How is COVID-19 treated?",
    A:
      "There is currently no FDA approved medication for COVID-19. People infected with this virus should receive supportive care such as rest, fluids and fever control, to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.   "
  },
  {
    Q: "Is there a vaccine?",
    A: "Currently, there is no vaccine available."

  {
    Q: "I am a roommate of someone who is sick. What should I do?",
    A:
      "Stay at home if you have symptoms of nose cold or a cough, a sore throat or a fever. These are mild symptoms. Avoid social contact. Limit visits to vulnerable people. Only call your doctor if the symptoms get worse (fever > 38 degrees Celsius and difficulty breathing) and you need medical assistance."
  },
  {
    Q: "Is the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) more severe than the regular flu?",
    A:
      "At this point, we do not know. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new virus. Therefore, it is vital to obtain very detailed information to determine precisely how dangerous the virus is. More information is needed about the spread of the virus, also about the people who become only slightly ill or not at all ill."
  },
  {
    Q:
      "What is the advice for people who are vulnerable or have health problems?",
    A:
      "Avoid contact with other people as much as possible. Avoid large groups and public transport. Everyone is urged to limit visits to people with health problems. Follow the hygiene measures and certainly stay away from people who are ill. "
  },
  {
    Q: "How long do you have to stay at home if you have a cold or a fever?",
    A:
      "People with a fever or a cold should stay at home. You also have to limit your social contacts. One day after the symptoms are over, you are no longer contagious. Contact your GP by telephone if you need medical assistance, for example, if you have a high fever or have difficulty breathing."
  },
  {
    Q: "I am pregnant, should I be particularly worried?",
    A:
      "No. We see that the virus infection has the same course as in women who are not pregnant. As far as we know, there is no increased risk of miscarriage or birth defects due to infection with this virus. Based on the current available data, the consequences of an infection with COVID-19 in a pregnant woman do not appear to be different for the child and the mother than for other infectious diseases that cause fever."
  },
  {
    Q: "Can I still go shopping?",
    A:
      "If you don't have any symptoms such as a fever, a cough or a cold, you can go and do some grocery shopping. If you keep an arm's length away from others, the chance that others will infect you with COVID-19 or that you will infect others is small."
  },
  {
    Q: "Can I still walk the dog?",
    A:
      "If you do not have any symptoms such as a fever, a cough or a cold, you can walk your dog. If you keep an arm's length away from others, there is little chance that others can infect you with COVID-19 or that you can infect others."
